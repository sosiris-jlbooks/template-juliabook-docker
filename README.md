## Jupyter Book

[Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/index.html) creates a beautiful website from Markdown and Jupyter Notebook files.

## CI/CD

When changes are pushed to GitHub, continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) will build the notebooks and publish the website. Execution results are executed on the fly so you can push notebooks with empty output cells and obtain the execution results generated by the CI service.

### GitHub actions

To enable GitHub pages for the generated website:
Open your repository settings => Pages => GitHub Pages
=> Build and deployment => Source, Select `GitHub actions`

=> Build and deployment => Source, Select the `gh-pages` branch.

## Auto update Julia dependencies

See [update-manifest.yml](.github/workflows/update-manifest.yml).

This template repository periodically updates Julia dependent packages and make a PR if the notebooks are executed successfully with the updated packages.

[See the instructions](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for how to trigger CI workflows in a PR. In this repo, I use a custom [GitHub APP](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens) to generate a temporary token.

## Renovate Bot

Config file: [renovate.json](renovate.json).

Other dependency updates (GitHub actions, python packages, dockerfiles) are done by the [Renovate bot](https://docs.renovatebot.com/). Please enable the [Renovate Github APP](https://github.com/apps/renovate) to use it.
